# Portfolio Design - Exercise  
A client **Barbie** would like a portfolio website to show her work to the public. She has made it clear that she would like to continously grow her website depending on the functionality she would like to use. For now she just wants a static website built on the HTML, CSS and possibly JavaScript but later. Only when she wants a blogging feature, she would ask for a CRUD application.
